# stockpricesugggester
Python program that suggest buy and sell prices based on short term volatility.
This is console based and very simple.  The stocks must be changed inside the code.
I am planning on turning this into a GUI Application, that will allow for users to select stocks.
I plan on adding chart functionality to show the short-term price changes.
