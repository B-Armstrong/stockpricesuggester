# stockpricesuggester
Python program that suggest buy and sell prices based on short term volatility.
This is console based and very simple.
## August 3rd 2022 Update:
adapted software to be a class module.  The module accepts a string of comma seperated stock tickers.
It prints and saves suggested buy and sell prices of stock for the upcoming trading day.
example input: 'meta,aapl,msft,goog'
will return buy and sell prices of Meta, Apple, Microsoft and Google common stock as well as save
the suggestions to a text file.  Investing in stocks is risky and financial decisions should not
be based on the output of this program alone.  
This program is for educational purposes only!
